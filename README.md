## Project Overview

This project consists of 3 tasks.

+ Task 1: Data preparation and customer analytics

Conduct analysis on your client's transaction dataset and identify customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations.

+ Task 2: Experimentation and uplift testing

Extend your analysis from Task 1 to help you identify benchmark stores that allow you to test the impact of the trial store layouts on customer sales.

+ Task 3: Analytics and commercial application

Use your analytics and insights from Task 1 and 2 to prepare a report for your client, the Category Manager.

## Installation

+ Download R Software: https://cran.r-project.org/

+ Install required libraries:

```r 
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("ggmosaic")
install.packages("readr")
``` 

## Task 1

+ Analyse the data to understand the current purchasing trends and behaviours.
+ The client is particularly interested in customer segments and their chip purchasing behaviour. 
+ LIFESTAGE: Customer attribute that identifies whether a customer has a family or not and what point in life they are at e.g. are their children in pre-school/primary/secondary school. 
+ PREMIUM_CUSTOMER: Customer segmentation used to differentiate shoppers by the price point of products they buy and the types of products they buy. It is used to identify whether customers may spend more for quality or brand or whether they will purchase the cheapest options. 

### Insights

1. Sales have mainly been due to Budget - older families, Mainstream - young singles/couples, and Mainstream  - retirees shoppers. 
2. The high spend in chips for mainstream young singles/couples and retirees is due to there being more of them than other buyers. 
3. Mainstream, midage and young singles and  couples are also more likely to pay more per packet of chips. This is indicative of impulse buying behaviour.
4. Mainstream young singles and couples are 23% more likely to purchase Tyrrells chips  compared to the rest of the population. 

**Thus, the Category Manager may want to increase the categoryâ€™s performance by off-locating some Tyrrells and smaller packs of chips in discretionary space near segments  where young singles and couples frequent more often to increase visibilty and impulse behaviour.**
